Application
- Application can be up and running by using the command
    > docker-compose up
- One container will run for the application(xyzbank-api), one container will run for MySql db(mysqldb)
- Swagger ui can be reached put by using this url -> http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

Token generation
- I use a uuid as a token but a JWT token would be more convenient

Unit tests
- Test entity builders can be added to unit tests
- More unit tests can be added

Drawbacks
- I should use document format for ID document but I used a String
